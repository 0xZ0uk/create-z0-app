# create-z0-app

A CLI tool for creating Next.js apps inspired by T3.

## Motivation

I really love developing with the T3 stack, however I still find myself doing the same setup over and over again.
This CLI tool is an attempt at fixing that.

### Why should you use this?

Rule of thumb, you shouldn't. Use the create-t3-app instead.
This is my modified and opinionated version of it.
