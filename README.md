# create-z0-app

A CLI tool for creating Next.js apps inspired by T3.

## Motivation

I really love developing with the T3 stack, however I still find myself doing the same setup over and over again.
This CLI tool is an attempt at fixing that.

### Why should you use this?

**Rule of thumb, you shouldn't.** Use the create-t3-app instead.
This is heavily modified version of it, that encapsulates my development style and the tools I use the most.
Even if it fits your development needs, I would avoid it has it won't have the same sort of maintenance.

If you still choose to use it:

1. I warned you.
2. Please leave some feedback.

### What's different?

- Built with Bun
- shadcn/ui pre-installed
- Zustand pre-installed
- No Auth
- Next.js App Directory only
- Structured source directory
